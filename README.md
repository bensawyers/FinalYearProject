# FinalYearProject
Using Q-learning to teach an autonomous agent how to play the Google dinosaur game.

Code initally based on the work of Code-bullet which can be found here https://github.com/Code-Bullet/Google-Chrome-Dino-Game-AI

## Instructions

There are 3 executables which can be run to show the game running the Q-learning algorithm after 8 hours of training, the Q-learning algorithm with no training, and the Genetic Algorithm. These 3 executables can be found in the following locations:

- **Q-learning algorithm with 8 hours of training** <br>
   *DinoGame/Executables/Trained Qlearn*

- **Q-learning algorithm with no training** <br>
   *DinoGame/Executables/Untrained Qlearn*
   
- **Genetic algorithm** <br>
   *DinoGame/Executables/Genetic Algorithm*
   
Each of these directories contains folders for Mac and Windows operating systems. If the software is executed on Mac operating system the executable is found within the *application.macosx* folder. For example to run the genetic algorithm on Mac operating system the executable is found at:

*DinoGame/Executables/Genetic Algorithm/MAC/application.macosx*

If the software is being executed on Windows operating system the executable is found in the *application.windows64* folders respectively. For example to run the genetic algorithm on Windows 64 operating system the executable can be found at:

*DinoGame/Executables/Genetic Algorithm/WINDOWS/application.windows64*

All of the source code can be found in the main directory *DinoGame*. If you want to run and test the source code the Processing program will need to be downloaded and installed as all source code was written using this program. The download for Processing can be found at https://processing.org/download/. After it has been downloaded open the main directory within the application.

The controls for the software when it is running are as follows:

\+ : Increase speed of game <br>
âˆ’ : Decrease speed of game
