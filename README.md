# FinalYearProject
Using Q-learning to teach an autonomous agent how to play the Google dinosaur game.
<p>Code initally based on the work of Code-bullet which can be found here https://github.com/Code-Bullet/Google-Chrome-Dino-Game-AI</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>There are 3 executables which can be run to show the game running the Q-learning algorithm after 8 hours of training, the Q-learning algorithm with no training, and the Genetic Algorithm. These 3 executables can be found in the following locations:</p>
 **Q-learning algorithm with 8 hours of training**
